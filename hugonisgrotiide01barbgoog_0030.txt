si dominii ea tantum inisset ιιι ut poscenti domino reddenda
res esset, nimis debile futurum suisset dominium, οι nimis

3 Neque hic consideratur bona quis an mala fide rei pos·
sessionem nactus sit: alio enim obligatio est ex delicto, alia er
re. Lacedaemonii delicto se liberaverant, damnato Phoebida,

motu mat qui Cadmeam Thebanorum arcem contra loedus ceperat, scd

emm ipsi binjustitiae accusati quod arcem nihilominus retinerent
Eamque injustitiam, ut singularem, etiam singulari Dei pro·

ammae videntia vindicatam notavit Xenophon. Sic M. Crassum et

home. ιιι Q. Hortensium reprehendit Cicero, quod hereditatis partem
retinuissent ex testamento, quodfalsum, sed stne corum culpa,
confectum erat.

4 Quia vero hoec obligatio tanquam ex contractu univer-
sali omnes homines tenet, et jus quoddam rei domino parit, eo
tit nt singulares contractus, quippo tempore posteriores, excep-

enarrationem inde accipiant. Inde lucem accipit illud Tryphonini:

he who basin his power athing belonging ιο another, is to restore ιι
to the owner. For if ownership were only so iar effective, that tho
thing is to be restored to the owner itha aska for it, ownership would

be too feeble, and custody too expensive.

session of the thing bono fida or mala fide, bellering that he has arighi,

the thing (and possession of ιι) is another. The Laccdaemoniam

but as thoy, neverthcless, retained -the citadel, they were charged Ἴ
with injustice: and this injustice, as being flagrant, was avenged by
a singular providcuco oi God, as Xenophon notes. So Cicero

legacies by a vvill which was false, though fabricated without fault of
theirs. =
