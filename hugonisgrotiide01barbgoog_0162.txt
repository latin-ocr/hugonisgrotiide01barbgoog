tali modo tacta efficit, ut si iactum praestari nequeat, nihil
aliud sit in obligatione: succedit enim certum loco incerti
quod interest Erat autem communis istorum temporum seu-
tentia, etiam vitam'walido οοιιο obligari.

sponsione bona primum adid quod interest, et ai ea non suffi-
ciant, corpus ud servitutem obligari. eFabius olim Maximus
eum pactum quoddam ejus cum hostibus fedum senatus im-
probasset, suudum suum ducentis millibus vendidit, et fidei
satisfecit. Samnites vero ‘Brutulum Papium induciarum rup-

thing certain into the place of au uncertain compensation. Audet
that time the common opInion was, that aman's lite might be senously
given as a pledge.

Ι 4 But with us who think differently, I am of opinion that by such
accurention, first, the party’s goods are liuble for compensatiou of the
Interest affected, aad it they are not sufficIent, that hle body is for· ·
.feited ιο alarery. When Fabius Maximus had made au agreement
with the enemy, which the Senate repudiatcd‚ he sold his lauded pro-
perty for 200,000 sesterces, and made good the loss, And the Samnites
rIghtly conceived that Brutulus Papius, who broke a unce, should be
given up along with his property.

distingnIsh whether the οοιιιοιιιίοιι Ismade sirnply‚ or under condition
of being ratlfied by the supreme power. For it so, this condition, not
fulfilled, (for conditi0ns must be expressly fultilled,) nullifies the ceu·
