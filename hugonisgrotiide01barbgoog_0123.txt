dum censemus inter actus Regis qui regii sunt, et aetus ejus·
dem privatos. Nam in regiis actibus quae rex iacit eo loeo

sicut leges ab ipsa communitate factae vim nullam haberent,
quia communitas seipsa superior non est, ita nec leges regia.

As to the tirst head, it is made a questIon whether the king, as he
can relieve his subjecte frons an cath, can do tho saure to himself, and
put himself back into his original condition. Bodinus thinks that tho
king may be so reinstated, on the same grounds as a subject would be
so; whether he hare been circumventcd ιγ the fraud and deception
of another party, or by his own error, or fear3 and this, both in
matters which effect the rights of the sorereignty‚ and those which

’ pertein to private advantage. He adds, that the kingis not even
bound ιγ un ooth, if the conventione made are of.that kind from
which the ‘law permits partios to recede, eron though the agreement
is conformable to proprioty; for (he holds) heis not therefore bound,
tecam he has swern, but because every one is bound ιγ just oon·
ventione, so iar ae tbe interest of another is concerned.

, 2 We make a distinction here, as we have done in otherplsees‚
hwaetes-fleurcntnnaermneaumomom
rson which are private acts. For in royal acts, what the king does
is to be held ns if it were donc ιγ the community: and as laws made
ιγ the community itsclf would hare no force oser such acts, because
tho eommunity is not superior to itself‚ so neither hare laws made ιγ
the king any such force. rlhcrcforo against such contracte, restitution
will not hold: for this restitution is serenturo of the civil Law. '
And thus kings ure not reliewed from contracte which they had mado
as minora.
