the obligatior, but the enrrier of the obligatorJ instrument; therefore
letters indicating consent may be carried by any one. We must
distinguieh also betweena minister who is elected to maire known the
promise, and him who is elected ιο make the promise. In the former
ease, the revocation will have its force, even if it do not ιεοοιιιο ιιιοιιιι
ιο the minister: in the other ease, the revocation is void, because the
right of promising vas dependent on the will of the minister or agent,
which wilt-the revocation net being Jet known, was free from all
fault. So also in the former ease, the donation ‚noy be neeepted, even
the donorbeing dordr as being perfect on one side, although revocablyr
as may be seen on a largo scale in ambassadors: in the other csse, the
donation cannot be accepted, because it was not really made, but only
ordered ιο be made.

2 But ιιι a doubtful ease, the will of the person who gives
the order is understood ιο be, ιιιιιι the order be sulfilled‚ except some
great change take place, as the death of the person ordering. But
there may be conjectures which moy favour another judgmcnt, which
are readily to be admitted, in order that a donation ulrich was directed
ιο bo made for ιι pious cause moy subsist. And in like manner may
s controversy be deeidod which was once agitated, whether en action
will hold against the heir οι ιι person entrnstcd with such s charge,
