have a king of their own, but the king whom the Germana had elected:

. yet so that they might retain some power οἰ confirming or annulliag

the electior, so t‘ar as they were concerned.

· 4 This approbaticn was wont to be proclaimed by the Bishop, aud
solcmnly celebrated 1)] a special coronation, [that of King of the Ru·
mana] Wherefore he who is elcctcd by the Seven Princcs who re·
present Germany, has authority to rute over the Germans according
-to their usages. But the same person is, by the approbation ot* the
Roman peoplc, made Roman Emperor, or King, or, as historiens often
speak, King of thc kingdom of Italy. And by that title, he has under

’ him whatever belonged to thc people ot* Rome, and that has not passed

nuder the authority of other peoples by compact, or by occupatiori of

derchot, or by the right of conquest.
And hence we easily understand by what right the Bishop of

Rome, during the vaconcy of the Empire, gives the investitores of
the fies of the Roman Empire3 numely, because he is tho first person
iu the Roaran peoplc, which at that timu is free. For whatever
'office belongs to any body, is wont to bo dischargcd by the first person
cf that body, as wo have elsewhere aoid.
