Add to this, that when the uill is sufficiently signified, the owner-
ship of a thing may be transferred, as we hare already said: uby then
may there not also be ιι transfer of a jus ιἰι personam, a right to the ·
performance oi a person's promise, or a right ιο transfer onncrship
(which is a less thing than onnership itself,) οι a right to do anything3
since we hare the same right orer our actions as orer tho things
which belong to us?

4 To this is to bc added the consent of wisc men; for as it is said
by jurists, that nothing is so natural as that the will of tho owner
when hc wishes to transfer to another a thing which is his, should be
held ralid ι in the same way it is said that nothing is so congruens to
the mutual confidenee of mankind, as to perform the agreements which
hare been made among men. Thus tho edict concerning paping'
money agreed to be pald at a certain time, wlrcn in the person so
agreeing ιιο cause had preceded except consent, is said to favour natu·
