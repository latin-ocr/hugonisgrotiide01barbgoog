fedus factum erat.

2 Videndum deinde, an praeter silentium res aliqua
accesserit: nam sine re aut iacto aliquo silentium non satis
probabilem voluntatis conjecturam suppeditat, ut ex his, quse
de dominii derelictione snpra diximus, intelligi potest. Sed
si actus aliqui accesserint, qni ad aliam eausam probabiliter
referri nequeant, tum recte intelligitur actus ratus esse habitus:
modo probatum id quod eum Gaditanis convenerat, notat
Cicero pro Balbo. Q*

3 Silentium adsersus Carthaginienses urgebant Romani,
de pactione cum Asdrubale facta. Sed eum illa pactio serbis polemone.
concepta esset negantibus, ne Poeni amnem Iberum transirent,

vix erat ut silentium solum ad inducendam ratihabitionem
facti alieni valeret, quippe eum factum proprium nullum secu-

2 We must next see whether, besides silence, any other circum·
sance has been added. For silence, without some thing or act, does

not supply a sufficiently probable conjectnmottheyillgstmy bo

ship. But ir any act hare boen added which cannot be probably
referred ιο another cause, then the act οι concention is rightly under·
stood ιο ιο accepted asralid. Andsotlre consention withthe Gadi· .
tani was proved salid, as Cicero notes.

3 Τιο Romans urged silence against the Carthaginians in refer·
enee ιο the convention made with Asdrubal. But since that consen·
tion was conceired in negative expressions-that the Carthaginians
should not pass the Ebro-it was scarcely a caso in which silence
alona could establish a ratification es the act ot another: since no act
οι chetrs had followed, except it might he that some Carthaginians,
wishing ιο pass the Ebro, had been presented by the Romans, and
the Carthaginians had acquiesced: lor such an nct has tho force οἰ a
positivo act, and is not merely negativo. But il' tho pact of Lutatius
had had more parts, and it appeared that the other parts, though
dissenting from common rule, had been obsersed by the Romans, then
there would be a sufficient proos οι ιιο confirmation ot the con·

cantion.
