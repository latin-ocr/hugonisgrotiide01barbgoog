missum est, sed quod interest: ceterum pacta, qnam ex se
non habent rim, eam accipere aut ex contractibus, quibus
insunt aut adjiciuntur, aut ex rei traditione: unde nasci par-
tim actiones, partim exceptiones, ct vetitam repetitionem.

Qum rere pacta rim obligandi secundnm leges habeant, ut

,, pacta stipulata, et alia quaedam, habere caru legum beneficio,
quarum ea cst efficacia, ut quod pcr sc honestum est, id efficere
possint etiam necessarium. ’

3 Verum hac sententia, ita generaliter ut ab ipso effer-
tur accepta, consistere non potest. Primum enim sequitur
inde inter reges et populos diversos, pactorum, quamdiu nihil
ex iis praestitum est, rim esse nullam, prasertim iis in locis,
ubi nulla certa forma foederum aut sponsionum reperta est.
Tum vero ratio nulla reperiri potest, cur leges, quae quasi pac-
tum commune sunt populi, atque hoo nomine vocantur ab

323ny Aristotele et Demosthene, obligationem pactis possint addere;

affl„ voluntas autem cujusque, hoc omni modo agentis ut se obliget,

§52¹2st idem non possit, praecipue ubi lex civilis impedimentum non

affert. Adde quod, voluntate sufficienter significata, trans·
ferri rei dominium potest, ut ante diximus: quidni ergo

having been tehen, he pronounces that‘what you ought ιο do, is not
what is promised, but what ie for the interest of tho promiseez-that tho
pects, not haring any force of themselves, receive force from the con-
tracts of which they aro parts or additions, or from the delirery of the
thing in question, whence arise, partly actions, partly exceptione to
actions, and prohihitions of suit.

But pects which hare an obligatory force according ιο ιιο Laws,
es pects with stipulations and some others, hare, he holds, this force
by the help of the laws, which hare this efficacy, that what of itself is
proper, they make to be necessary.

ι 3 Βιιι this opinion cannot stand, in the general form in which he

» ι, propounds it. For, in the first place, it follows therefrom that pacts
J between kings and different peoples, so long asnothing theroof is per·
3 formed (re inteyrd) hare nc feuco; [the parties being bound by no
ξ commen instituted law ς] especially in those places in which no regular
form of treatics and engagemeuts has been introduced.

And again, no reason can be found why laws, which are in a cer.
tain way a common pact of the people, and are so called by Aristotle
and Demosthenes, should bo able te gire obligatory force to pacts3
while the will of a person, directed especially, and by erory mouns, to
put himself under an obligation, should not be able to do so 3 especially
when tho civil Law offers no impediment.
