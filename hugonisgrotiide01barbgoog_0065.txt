aut meri, aut cum mutua quadam obligatione. Beneficimeri,
aut in praesens absoluantur, aut in futurum prominent. ln
praesens absolsitur iactum utile, dequo nihil loqui necesse est,
quando utilitatem quidem parit, aednaham juris effectum:
item donatio, qua dominium transfertur, qun de re egimus
supra eum de dominii acquisitionibus ageretur. In futurum
prominent promissiones tum dandi, tum faciendi, dequibus
jamjam egimus. Benefici actus cum obligatione mutua sunt,
qui aut de re disponunt sine alienatione, ant de iacto ita ut
aliquis effeetus supersit. Talis est circa rem usus concaede,
qui commodatio dicitnr: in lactis praestatio operae sumtuosa,
aot obligatorias, qnae dicitnr mandatum, cujus species est de·
positum, praestatio scilicet operae in re custodienda. His
autem actibus similes sunt actuum promissiones, nisi qood, ut
diximus, hae in suturam prominent: quod et de actibus jam
explicandis intellectum volumus.

Il. Oisimple acts, some are gratuitooslybeuefieiot, others are oithe

nature of erchangc of one act for another, permutatoriol. Beneficial ’

acts are either merely so, or with some mutual obligation. Merebene·
ficial acts are either discharged in the present time, or stand orer ior
the future. A useful good office is performed in the present time, and
of this it is not necessary ιο speak, since it produces advantage indeed
by the recipient, but no effect as oi right: so also a donation, by which
ownership is transferred, of which we treated above, when we spoke of
acquisitione of ownership. As acts standing orer for the future, we
reckon promises both of giving and os doing; concerning which wehare
already spoken.

Beneficial acts with a mutual obligation, are those which dispose
of any thing without alienation, or so dispose of an aet thatsome effect
surriwes. Such is a concession of theuso ot a thing, which is called a
Loan3 and of acts, the undertaking of an office expensiwe or obligatur-y,
which wc ma5 call a Commissiom oi which kind is a Deposit, namclp,
the office ot keoping a thing in custody. Similar ιο those acts ure the
promises of acts, except that, as we hare said, these stand over ior the
rutum which also we desire to hare understood oi the acts now ιο be

laincd.
