Csr. xxi] DE POENARUM COMMUNIOATIONE. 365

quum esse et omnium civitatnm3 cni tamen mors leges pos·
teriores Romanae multum temperamenti adjecerunt. Sic cum parm n a
ex delicto majoris partis, quae, nt alibi diximus, personamw ιιιι cdlii
universitatis sustinet, universitas in culpa est, eoque nomine
amittit ea quae diximus, libertatem civilem, muros, et alia
commoda, sentiunt damnum ct singuli innocentes3 sed ea in
re, quae ad ipsos non pertinebat nisi pcr universitatem.

XI. 1 Praeterea notandum, interdum imponi alicui ali·
qnid mali, aut boni aliquid auferri, occasione quidem alicujus
peccati alieni, sed non ita ut id peccatum causa sit proxima
ejus aetionis, quod y'us ipsum agendi attinet. Sic qui occa·
sione alieni debiti aliquid promisit, rnalum patitur, cx veteri
verbe, ἐγγύα, oropo* δ’ ἄτα· sponde, ricco praesto est: at
proxima causa obligationis est ipsa promissio. Nam utqui
pro emtore fidejussit, non proprio ex emto tenetur, sed ex
promisso: ita et qui pro delinquente, non ex delicto, sed ex
sua sponsione. Atque hinc iit quod malum illi ferendum
mensuram accipit non ex delicto alterius, sed ex potestate ,
quam ipsein promittendo babuit.

2 Cui consequens est, ut ex sententia, quam veriorem

Lepidus should bear the same lot. lind this, hc says, was the ancient
custom, and common to all citics; though this custom was much
limitcd aud temper-cd by the later lans of Rome. So when hythe
delict of the general body, which, as wc heresuid, stands for thc whole
body, the whole body is in fault, and on that ground loses, as wc hare
said, ciril liberty, city walls, and other advantagcs, innocent indi-
viduale also fecl the inconvenienccs3 bnt they scel it iu those things
which only belonged to them through tbc general body.

XI. 1 It is further to bc remarkcd, that sometimes a person has
harm imposed upon him, or loscs good, by tho occasion iudecd of ’
another’s fault, yet not sc that the fault is tho proximare causo oi the
action, so far as pertains to the right of acting. Thus he who has
promised something on occasion of anothcr's dcbt, suffers damage, as
the old proverb says, Suretyahip is ποτε door to orisciicfi· but the
proximate cause oi the obligatior is his promise. For as hc who is
surcty ior a buycr, is not properly bound by tho sale, but by his pro·
mise ς so he who is bound ior a delinquent, is not bound by tho delict,
but by his own engagement. And hence thc loss which he has to
bear is mousurcd, not by the other's delict, but by thc ponor which
bc had in promising.

2 From which lt follows, that according to ihc opinion which we
hold for thc sounder, no body can bc put to death in virtue of surcty·
ship; because we hold that no one has such right orer his own lise,
